OnePlus 7T was released in September of 2019, This phone featured a Snapdragon 855+ Processor with varying amount of ram from 8GB and came packed with 128GB or 256GB of space*.*
Actual space may vary due to android system files and applications pre-installed.
OnePlus 7T currently a device that is over a year old that is still produced for some markets including United States specifically for T-Mobile.
Included in the box for the OnePlus 7T
 * Warp Charge 30T
 * OnePlus 7T Phone
 * Rubber Case
 * USB-C Cable with Type-A on the End and Type-C for Phone
 * Screen Protector (not included on T-Mobile Variant)

OnePlus 7T features a 90hz refresh rate on a fluid amoled screen with HDR10+ it is rocking a 1080p by 2400 screen resolution on a 6.55 inch tear drop display. The screen is also a not curved giving alot more grip while holding it in a case  or even without a case for the device.
Battery on the OnePlus 7T came equipped with a 3800 mah battery that is non removable. The device for the work use can last around 5to 7 hours of screen on time for a full days use.
 7T comes equipped a nice triple camera setup 48mp wide lens+16mp ultra wide +12mp telephoto and the front facing selfie camera is equipped with a 16mp wide lens  that supports 1080p at 30fps recording. the rear cameras also support video recording of up to 4k at 60fps and 720 at up to 960fps.
In a work situation the camera setup is quite good if you need a quick picture for a client or a quick preview for your journalism field work assignment.
Software features for field work, the Oneplus 7t comes equipped with some pretty unique features, including screen recording, call recording(depends on region), google spam filter (depends on region and phone model) and device encryption.
Screen recording is a feature that can work well for interviews during a traveling situation or remote situation which requires you to record the interview on the go it allows you to record audio and video and saves it to the device for quick and easy access. This feature I have used quite a few times on the go its very important feature as a journalist, photographer and even in general really.
With alot of the features the OnePlus 7T comes equipped with and the physical appearance of the device alot of pluses and downsides too it. I would recommend the device if you need a very good older flagship phone with alot of processing power for a lower price.
